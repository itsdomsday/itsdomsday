- 👋 Hi, I’m @itsdomsday, you can call me Dom or Doms
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and anime stuff as a hobby, but I'm also into programming stuff. I want to continue my career with programming
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my programming knowledge, as my knowledge with programming is a bit outdated since it's been a while since I last touched a programming language. This will help me continue my career
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making apps or games if possible. I don't have experience as of the moment, but I'm willing to learn and gain experience along the way
- 📫 How to reach me? You can send an email at dgvcristobal@gmail.com or you can reach me at Discord where I'm very active itsdomsday#2192
